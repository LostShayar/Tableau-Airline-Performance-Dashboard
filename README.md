Overview:
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of international airline data using an interactive Tableau dashboard. The dashboard is designed to uncover patterns in ticket pricing, travel time, and airline performance to help users find the most cost-effective and time-efficient travel options.

Key Features and Analyses:
Interactive Dashboard: A central dashboard integrates multiple visualizations, allowing for real-time filtering and exploration of travel trends, ticket prices, and wait times by airline or flight configuration.

Data Cleaning and Transformation: The project involved significant data preparation within Tableau, including removing null values, converting ticket prices from strings to numeric values, and parsing time fields for accurate calculations3333.

Performance Metrics: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were developed using aggregate functions to compute metrics such as average travel time and average ticket prices across different airlines and routes.

Visualizations Included

Flight Volume by Airline: A packed bubble chart visualizes the distribution of flight volume, highlighting high-frequency carriers.

Ticket Price by Number of Stops: A bar chart clearly demonstrates that flights with more stops have significantly higher average ticket prices, with nonstop flights being the most economical.

Travel Time vs. Ticket Price: A scatter plot explores the relationship between flight duration and cost, showing that longer travel times do not always mean more expensive tickets.

Route Pricing Analysis: A highlight table identifies cost-efficient routes by displaying average ticket prices for various departure and destination airport combinations.

First Stoppage Wait Times: A dot plot compares the average layover times for each airline, revealing potential inconsistencies in efficiency and passenger experience.
